# Arcade World - Team Margarita

## About

Arcade World is a place where you and your friends can come back in the good old days and compete against each other by playing some of the classic arcade games.
Score as many points as possible in the four games - Breakout, Snake, Tron, Ping Pong - and prove you're better than your opponent.

This is an educational team work project for the JavaScript UI and DOM course in Telerik Academy.
